        Udaipur, also known as the City of Lakes, is the crown jewel of the state of Rajasthan. It is surrounded by the beautiful Aravalli Hills in all directions, making this city as lovely as it is. This 'Venice of the East' has an abundance of natural beauty, mesmerising temples and breathtaking architecture which makes it a must-visit destination in India.  A boat ride through the serene waters of Lake Pichola will be enough to prove to you why Udaipur is the pride of Rajasthan.

    <p>
        The moment you set foot in Jaipur, you will feel like everything has come straight out of the pages of some epic novel. Majestic buildings, tales of heroic battles, resplendent forts and palaces, and multi-faceted characters ? Rajasthan is one of the most colourful and flashiest states in all of India, and its capital Jaipur lives up to the same reputation as well. Jaipur is a vibrant amalgamation of the old and the new ? highly urbanized pockets and shopping areas have casually sprung up beside gleaming forts and palaces. Jaipur has long been one of the shiniest cultural jewels in the history of the Indian subcontinent, and the royal corridors of the famously named 'Pink City' offer up a plethora of adventures and activities that make for a memorable holiday experience.
