    <h1>My Success Story</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Looking back at the past eleven weeks I have grown and learned so much here at <b>Anna University</b>. I never thought that I would actually accomplish my educational dreams and be successful in my life, but I definitely have proved, myself wrong. I love knowing that I am doing great and I really try to do my best in completing my homework on time, with the occasions of a few speed bumps along the way.
        <br>I decided to return to school to further my <a href="https://www.bartleby.com/essay/My-Success-Story-F3JHH54KTC">education</a> for many important reasons. I have struggled tremendously in the past with my five children and I wanted to change that life style for good. I am so very tired of trying to make ends meet and not.
        <br>I decided to just go for it and I am so glad I did because I know now that I have overcome that fear and I feel as if I can accomplish anything and everything. I can also say that I have matured in many ways as a mother, first time college student, and being a single mother of five. My kids had to adjust to the new routine as well. They did not understand at first but eventually they came around and little by little they gave me the time I needed to study and do homework. I still have to overcome a few obstacles in order to complete my degree program, just like I had to overcome all the changes that come with me returning to school.
